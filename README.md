## For developers
### Project Structure
All ViaForge versions from Minecraft version 1.12 onwards are on the `master` branch. <br>
The names of the submodules indicate the version, they are always given in the format `mc-<version name without .>`. <br>
`Minecraft 1.12.2` - `mc112` <br>
`Minecraft 1.16.4/5` - `mc116`

### ViaForge for Minecraft 1.8
Since ForgeGradle for Minecraft 1.8 is too old, it has its own branch called `legacy-1.8`

### I want ViaForge in my own utility mod
Just take a look at my other Project called `ViaMCP`: https://github.com/FlorianMichael/ViaMCP
