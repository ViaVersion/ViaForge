## For developers
### Project Structure
All ViaForge versions from Minecraft version 1.12.2 onwards are on the `master` branch. <br>
The names of the submodules indicate the version, they are always given in the format `mc-<version name without .>`. <br>
`Minecraft 1.12.2` - `viaforge-mc1122` <br>
`Minecraft 1.16.5` - `viaforge-mc1165` <br>
`Minecraft 1.17.1` - `viaforge-mc1171` <br>
`Minecraft 1.18.2` - `viaforge-mc1182` <br>
`Minecraft 1.19.4` - `viaforge-mc1194` <br>
`Minecraft 1.20.4` - `viaforge-mc1204` <br>

### ViaForge for Minecraft 1.8
Since ForgeGradle for Minecraft 1.8.9 is too old, it has its own branch called `legacy-1.8`

### I want ViaForge in my own utility mod
Just take a look at my other Project called `ViaMCP`: https://github.com/FlorianMichael/ViaMCP
